# ai_autonomous_city_simulation
This project proposes a simplified AI Autonomous City Simulation, where multiple agents—such as workers, shop owners, students, and police officers—live and act autonomously in a shared virtual city. The purpose is to design a clear multi-phase workflow that governs daily cycles, agent decisions, and city-level updates.
